# What is git?

Git is a technology to sync our codebase across devices.

Think about this:
- When your writing code, the code is stored on your computer (and everyone else on the team)
- How does the team know which version of files are is 'real' one?
- How do you communicate your changes to your team members?

Rather than sharing files directly, which leads to a lot of organization issues, Git has the following helpful features that this training will help you to understand and use. This is a basic, non-comprehensive list:

- packaging your changes into 'commits' to communicate chucks of changes to your colleges
- Working on different 'branches' of your project to work on different projects on a shared codebase without having to have untested changes on the main branch
- Removing, adding back, and squashing together changes quickly
- Formally sharing your code with the team with 'pull requests'
- Resolve conflicts over what the code should be with your subteam members without messing up the 'official' version of the file.
